# Terminal-Tetris
Different versions of tetris written in C for linux terminal.

### Description
Tetris is a game in the form of a matrix where blocks of different shapes must be placed so that the board is kept as full as possible for as long as possible. The idea is to place each block in the location that eliminates as many rows and / or columns as possible. These are automatically deleted when they are full. In this project, we want to take inspiration from Tetris and create a whole new version for it.

### How to Run?
Download and extract the zip then execute the command below with terminal in the extracted folder.
```bash
make && ./tetris
```
